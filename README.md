## Code-Quiz-APIs

# Decription  

- In this project, I used javascript to control the DOM creating a code quiz. I built this project to showcase my skills in DOM manipulation. I learned a lot creating this project. One of those things were that the order of your javascript makes a huge difference sometimes. 

- Some of the challenges I came across was writing my code in such a way as to not be repetitive. I overcame that by looking over my code and eliminating anything that could be done with less lines.
